# image-generator

Webpack and responsiveness to `npm start` still in development.

To view and use the application, stay on master branch and run `npm install` then serve html file statically. (Open the html file directly in your browser).

A bug I am aware of is that once it reaches the maximum images available through the (free) API, it will not show any more new images. I am still in search of a relatively intuitive free API with stock images!

Thanks for visiting!
